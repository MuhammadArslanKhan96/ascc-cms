/**
 * schema.org version: v15.0-release
 * EndorsementRating - An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement,
 * for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a "Like" or "+1" on a
 * social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]]
 * in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by some
 * [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more
 * useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly
 * describing the [[Action]].  An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a
 * numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an
 * explicit type for indicating a positive, endorsement rating is particularly
 * useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand
 * that the rating is broadly positive.
